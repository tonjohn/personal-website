======================================
1. Introduction
======================================

This addon allows you to have a "DevTracker".

A DevTracker is basically a modified search that displays
all posts made by users in specified usergroups.

======================================
2. Installation
======================================

1. Upload all of the files in the "upload" directory to your
vBulletin installation.

2. Add the DevTracker product from the admin control panel.

======================================
3. Usage
======================================

A new group should appear in your admin control panel
sidebar called "DevTracker". Simply go to the "DevTracker"
manager and add a devgroup.

Clicking on the "Tag" will take you to the results for that
group. You can then distribute that URL to your users in any
way you wish.

E.g.
http://www.example.com/forum/devtracker.php?g=administrators

The above example may be a devgroup set up to show all posts by
anyone in the Administrator group.

There are also 2 options for the DevTracker product, they can be
found in the usual vBulletin Options (typically at the very
bottom).

The options determine if a cache should be used (defaults to
"yes", highly recommended to use the cache, especially on
large forums), and the maximum age of the cache before performing
a new search (defaults to 15 minutes).
