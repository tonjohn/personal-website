				<h2>Motivated and passionate about his work and Valve, it's a real pleasure to be able to count on him at all times. - Francois Roughol, Ubisoft</h2>
				
				<hr />
				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>Burton has been a gamer since the days of Wolfenstein and Doom. In fact, Burton and his brother spent their summer days playing against each other in Duke Nukem 3D and Command & Conquer. Being a gamer, he has naturally always been interested in computer hardware, building his first computer at age thirteen and eventually becoming an IT Specialist at a research firm in Dallas--Axiometrics Inc.</p>
				<p>After visiting Electronic Arts Inc.'s headquarters in January of 2007 and having conversations with several producers, Burton realized that the gaming industry was the right place for him. He was offered his dream job at Valve Software and left Southern Methodist University, where he had spent the last three years pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science on the Gaming Track, for his new home in Bellevue, Washington.</p>
				<p>As Community Developer at Valve, Burton performs a wide variety of duties ranging from basic customer support and QA to overseeing various projects, creating new features for our community, and working with the Steam and game developers to improve Valve's products.</p>
