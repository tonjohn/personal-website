				<b>Francois Roughol</b><br>
				Level Designer, Ubisoft
				<p>As a Steam moderator, my experience working with Burton has always been extremely positive. Burton is able to remain constantly positive and very helpful, while projecting in the future to see the future challenges and work on them ahead of time. Motivated and passionate about his work and Valve, it's a real pleasure to be able to count on him at all times.</p>
